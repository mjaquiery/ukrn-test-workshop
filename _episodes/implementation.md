## Overview

Data sharing at the end of a project is much easier if you've planned and organised the project with data sharing in mind from the beginning.
We'll spend some time now considering our workflows and how best to implement data sharing throughout.

## Ethics

If you're sharing data about living humans, you probably have to obtain some kind of informed consent.
Make sure this consent includes consent to sharing anonymised data, sharing metadata, and offering controlled access to data, as appropriate.

- [ ] Draft or find some text for your ethics application that describes how you will use data

## File naming

How will you name files and directories?
If possible, can you lay out the directories you'll need for storing your project data before you begin?

## Version control

How will you track changes to your data?
Many repositories allow for uploading multiple versions of files.

## Data formatting

How will you format data? 
Can you use open formats rather than proprietary ones?

## Metadata

What metadata will you need to collect (don't rely on your memory for things!)?
How will you include that metadata -- metadata files, in the filenames, in the files themselves (e.g. headers), etc.?

## Sharing

Consider the size and purpose of the data you will collect.
Identify a repository or service that will hold the data.
Consider whether you can automatically upload data to the eventual holder as part of the collection workflow.

## Ongoing

### Maintaining data

Will your shared data need maintaining? 
Who will be responsible for this?

### Costs

How much does your data storage choice cost?
Are there ongoing costs?
